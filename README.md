Key Similarities to Your Tettra Situation:

1. Complex Integration Scenarios: Just like your PMS/OTA combinations, we have plugin combinations (WooCommerce + Mailchimp, Yoast + Elementor) with specific quirks and compatibility issues.

2. Real User Pain Points: The "black hole" search problem exists here too - users ask "why isn't my store syncing?" instead of searching for "WooCommerce Mailchimp API endpoint error 400."

3. Varied Article Quality: Some articles are well-structured (official docs), others are fragmented (GitHub issues, forum posts) - just like your Tettra content.

4. Multi-step Troubleshooting: Solutions require following specific sequences, understanding dependencies, and knowing when to escalate.
